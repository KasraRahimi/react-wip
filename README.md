# WIP
This project is currently a work in progress. As it stands, there aren't any specific goals in mind. I'm using this project as an opportunity to learn more about web design and react. I'm planning on writing the backend in go, but I need to work more on the frontend before that becomes as possibility.

## Installation
If you'd like to set up this project locally, you can do so by clonning the repository and installing the dependencies.
```
git clone git@github.com:KasraRahimi/react-wip.git
cd react-wip/frontend
npm i
```

## Running The Frontend
To start the front end you simply run the following command
```
npm run dev
```
